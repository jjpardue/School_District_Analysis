# School_District_Analysis
The school district analysis was one of the harder challenges and as I have heard, I am not alone. 

I always say, just because something is hard, doesn't mean it is wrong. However, on this challenge, I feel that I may have things that are, in fact, incorrect. There were some coding errors I just could not figure out in the final challenge. 

My assignment submission is late and I recieved approval to upload it tonight from the instructor. 

I feel that I am learning Python and the user interfaces appropriately, per what I have gathered from my cohort peers. However, and to be quite transparent, my brain is fried and while I have not a lot of thought outside of the code on this challenge - in terms of writing a detailed analysis - I wanted to submit it as-is and understand that my formal analysis of the challenge will not garner any points. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

I appreciate your feedback as you have it. 

Kindly and decisively,
Jenn Pardue
